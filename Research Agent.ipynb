    "My field is Multirobot Adaptive Navigation in Environmental Vector Fields, an interdisciplinary area combining robotics, control theory, and environmental sensing. This field addresses the challenge of deploying teams of autonomous robots to explore and navigate through naturally occurring vector fields—such as ocean currents, atmospheric flows, or electromagnetic fields—using only local, distributed measurements. Unlike traditional path planning where robots navigate to predetermined locations, adaptive navigation requires robots to discover and track dynamic features of interest (critical points, bifurcations, extrema) in real-time using collaborative sensing and estimation. The core technical challenges include: extracting meaningful information (gradients, jacobins, hessians, eigenvectors) from noisy distributed sensors, maintaining precise multi-robot formations while executing adaptive maneuvers, developing control primitives that exploit topological features of vector fields (sources, sinks, centers, critical points, saddles, bifurcations, separatrices), and bridging the gap between theoretical algorithms and physical implementations. The key to the research is that it only uses current sensor data to update the control law. No memory stores are needed, no feedback loops, yet, they reach their target or trajectory of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This field has critical applications in environmental monitoring (tracking pollution plumes, mapping ocean dynamics), search and rescue (following scent gradients), and scientific exploration (characterizing atmospheric phenomena), where understanding and navigating complex flow patterns is essential for mission success. Some of the math is attached as Paper II.\n",
